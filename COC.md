## Statement of Purpose

The Fantasyland Institute of Learning Code of Professionalism (FCOP) dictates the terms and conditions under which we allow you to participate in the _community_.

The purpose of FCOP is to facilitate an inclusive and diverse _community_ of professionals who productively work toward shared professional goals.

In service of this purpose, we open the _community_ to all _civil_ individuals and we require that all _members_ refrain from _unprofessional behavior_. We do not impose any ideology onto _members_, nor do we restrict participation based on people's _personal attributes_ or their _behavior_ in other communities.

## Welcome Statement

We welcome all _civil_ individuals regardless of any _personal attributes_ they have that are orthogonal to the professional goals of the _community_.

We pledge that we will enforce the terms and conditions set forth in FCOP, and that we will hold ourselves to these same standards, thereby setting a positive example for others to follow.

## Behavior

We permit only _civil_ individuals to participate in the _community_. We further require that _members_ refrain from _unprofessional behavior_.

### Active Participation

We encourage everyone to assume the best in every _interaction_; to be open, honest, and empathic in all _communication_; and to demonstrate politeness and professional courtesy in every situation.

We welcome any closed group of _members_ to engage in any _behavior_ for which there is explicit and unanimous mutual consent. In the absence of such consent, we impose the following restrictions during _active participation_, which are further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Discriminate**. Do not show or withhold favoritism on the basis of a _stereotype_.
* **Don't Harass**. Do not _interact_ with anyone who does not consent to the _interaction_.
* **Don't Pry**. Do not attempt to infer the private content or _communication_ of others.
* **Don't Shame**. Do not shame the _personal attributes_ of others.
* **Don't Stereotype**. _Communicate_ as if every individual were unique.

These requirements on _behavior_ apply to _members_ only while they are actively participating in the _community_. The standing of _members_ is unaffected by _behavior_ that does not comply with these requirements if this _behavior_ occurs in other communities.

### Inactive Participation

During _inactive participation_, you must behave as required in this section, and as further clarified by the **Glossary**.

* **Don't Dox**. Do not publish details of _members_ that you learn about during _active participation_.
* **Don't Retaliate**. Do not _retaliate_ against _members_ for the resolution or reporting of an _incident_.

These requirements on _behavior_ apply to _members_ at all times, even when they are not actively participating in the _community_.

## Reporting

**Reporting Requirements**. _Active participation incidents_ must be reported to us within 15 days by _aggrieved members_. We will investigate third-party reports at our sole discretion. _Inactive participation incidents_ must be reported to us within 5 years of their occurrence, by _members_ or _non-members_. Information that any _member_ or _non-member_ believes may affect our view of the _civility_ of individuals may be reported at any time.

**Unofficial Resolution**. For minor _incidents_, and only in cases where they prefer doing so, we encourage _aggrieved members_ to speak to _accused members_ directly, using the language of non-violent communication (NVC). At the request of an _aggrieved member_, we will appoint a mediator who can facilitate an unofficial resolution and serve as a witness.

**Official Resolution**. For official resolution, _aggrieved members_ must contact us, and we will appoint an _arbiter_. The _arbiter_ will speak individually to all parties, including witnesses, before deciding on a course of action, which will involve rejecting the _incident_, or accepting it as a _violation_ and imposing a consequence on the _violator_.

**Consequences**. _Violators_ may be asked to apologize or to undergo training, counseling, or mediation as a condition of continued participation. They may also be banned from the _community_, at the sole discretion of the _arbiter_. In no case will the consequence exceed banishment, unless the violation is also governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws. We reserve the right to re-evaluate a previously imposed _consequence_ based on new information or a change in community leadership.

**Social Rehabilitation**. We will only banish individuals for a determined number of years, not to exceed 5 years. Formerly banned parties can be reintegrated into the _community_ through a rehabilitation process determined by us.

**Confidentiality**. We may publicly share information about any _violation_ that results in banishment, including personally identifiable information on the violator, limited to name and online identities. We will keep other _incidents_ and the identities of _aggrieved_ and _accused_ confidential to the extent this confidentiality is fully respected by other involved parties.

## Rights

**Right to Contact Leaders**. _Members_ have a right to clear, up-to-date contact information for use in reporting _incidents_. _Members_ have a right to accurate estimation of how quickly _members_ will receive a response after an _incident_ is reported.

**Right to Know Boundaries**. _Members_ have a right to clear communication on the boundaries of the _community_. In addition, if any regions in time or space are specially exempted from part or all of FCOP, _members_ have a right to clear communication on these exemptions.

**Right to Non-Coercion**. _Members_ have a right to not be coerced to share private information, make statements, or otherwise perform any function that is not essential for the scope of participating in a given _community_ activity.

**Right to Disclosure**. _Uncivil_ or banned individuals have a right to a written, anonymized summary of the rationale and evidence resulting in the decision, including the identity of the _arbiter_ and their relationship to the _aggrieved_ and _accused_ (if applicable). Such individuals may publicly share this disclosure providing they do so in its entirety.

**Right to Unbiased Arbitration**. _Accused_ and _aggrieved members_ have a right to the appointment of either a balance _arbiter_, or a neutral _arbiter_ without vested interest in any particular outcome.

**Right to Merit Transparency**. _Members_ have a right to clear communication on whether the status, authority, or responsibility of individual _members_ is awarded or withheld based on relevant or non-relevant _personal attributes_.

## Miscellaneous

**Criminal Behavior**. FCOP is not intended to supplant the laws of governing jurisdictions, but to impose a set of terms and conditions on community membership that go beyond legal requirements. _Criminal behavior_ of any kind should be immediately reported to relevant authorities and dealt with as recommended by such authorities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if _criminal behavior_ also violates FCOP, we reserve the right to subject such behavior to arbitration.

**Disputes of Interpretation**. In the event there is a dispute about the meaning of any term or clause in FCOP, we alone will clarify the intent. We pledge to be consistent in our interpretation of any ambiguity, rather than utilizing different interpretations in different circumstances.

**Non-Endorsement**. In recognition of the pluralistic composition of the _community_, the _community_ does not endorse the views, values, religions, politics, beliefs, or attitudes of ourselves or of any _member_ of the _community_. No _member_ ever speaks for or represents the _community_, and neither do we speak for or represent the _community_ unless we are acting in our official capacities or claim to be doing so (and even then, only for the scope of the task at hand).

**Limitation of Remedy**. In the event we fail to uphold any of our obligations under FCOP, including the provision of member rights or upholding other pledges as made herein, the remedy is limited to a formal public apology, unless the breach is governed by separate contractual agreements or local laws.
